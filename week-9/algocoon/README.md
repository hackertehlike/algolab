#### 1. For each \( 0 \to i \):
- we're saying: **"I’m definitely taking figure 0, and I’m not taking figure \( i \)"**.
- The flow algorithm then acts as a **black box**:
  - It tells we the optimal way to **partition the remaining figures** into two groups:
    - **our group** (reachable from \( 0 \) without crossing \( i \)).
    - **our friend’s group** (everything disconnected from \( 0 \) because we’ve cut off \( i \)).

The flow result ensures:
- The **total cost of the limbs we cut** (to separate \( 0 \) from \( i \)) is minimized.
- we get the "cheapest combination" of figures to take home, under the condition that we must **exclude figure \( i \)**.

---

#### 2. Repeat for every \( i \):
- For every \( i \), we repeat this process:
  - Assume \( 0 \) is **ours**, and \( i \) is **our friend’s**.
  - Compute the **min-cut** (using flow), which determines the optimal partition of the other figures.
- Record the cost for each \( 0 \to i \) configuration.

---

#### 3. Symmetry: Reverse the Role of \( i \):
- As we noted, the above approach **only covers half the scenarios**, because it always assumes \( 0 \) is included in our group.
- To cover the other half:
  - Swap the roles: **Assume \( i \) is ours, and \( 0 \) is our friend’s.**
  - Compute the min-cut for \( i \to 0 \), and repeat the same process.

---

#### 4. Global Minimum:
- After computing all possible scenarios (both \( 0 \to i \) and \( i \to 0 \)):
  - Take the minimum cost from all configurations.
- This ensures that we’ve considered every possible way to split the sculpture into two valid groups.

---

### Why This Works

The **flow algorithm** guarantees that for each configuration, we’re getting the optimal partition of figures (minimizing cutting cost) under the fixed condition:
- Either \( 0 \) is in our group and \( i \) is not, or
- \( i \) is in our group and \( 0 \) is not.

By combining the results from both directions, we’ve exhaustively explored all possible partitions.

### Visualizing the Idea

1. **Forward Scenario (\( 0 \to i \))**:
   - **Input**: "I'm taking \( 0 \), and I’m giving away \( i \)."
   - **Output**: The best possible set of figures to take home, minimizing the cutting cost.

2. **Reverse Scenario (\( i \to 0 \))**:
   - **Input**: "I’m taking \( i \), and I’m giving away \( 0 \)."
   - **Output**: The best possible set of figures to take home, minimizing the cutting cost.

---

- **Flow acts as a black box** to find the optimal split under a fixed condition (e.g., "not taking \( i \)").
- Computing both \( 0 \to i \) and \( i \to 0 \) ensures that **all possible ways of splitting the sculpture** are considered.
- The result is the globally optimal solution.
