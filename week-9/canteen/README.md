### Approach: Min-Cost Max-Flow

This problem can be solved using a **Min-Cost Max-Flow** approach, where we model the days as nodes in a graph, connected to a super-source and super-sink.

---

#### General Approach (80/100)

1. **Graph Structure:**
   - **Nodes:** Each day is represented as a node in the graph.
   - **Edges:**
     - **Source to Days:** Represents meal production for each day.
       - Capacity: Number of meals that can be produced (`a`).
       - Cost: Production cost per meal (`c`).
     - **Days to Sink:** Represents serving students.
       - Capacity: Number of students wanting to eat (`s`).
       - Cost: Negative profit per meal (`-p`).
     - **Day-to-Day Edges:** Represents meals stored overnight.
       - Capacity: Number of meals that can be stored (`v`).
       - Cost: Storage cost per meal (`e`).

2. **Steps:**
   - Build the graph with the production, student demand, and storage constraints.
   - Solve the **Min-Cost Max-Flow** problem directly using an algorithm like `cycle_canceling` or `successive_shortest_path`.

3. **Why This Fails:**
   - The negative costs for serving students (`-p`) cause issues when using faster algorithms like `successive_shortest_path_nonnegative_weights`.
   - While this approach works in theory, it exceeds the **time limit** for the larger test cases because `successive_shortest_path_nonnegative_weights` requires all edge costs to be non-negative.

#### Optimized Approach: Using Normalization

To handle negative costs and enable the use of faster algorithms, we modify the costs as follows:

1. **Cost Normalization:**
   - Add a constant value (`+20`) to all edge costs, ensuring they are non-negative:
     - **Source to Days:** Costs become `c + 20`.
     - **Days to Sink:** Costs become `20 - p`.
     - **Day-to-Day Edges:** Costs remain `e` (already non-negative).

2. **Why Add `+20`?**
   - The profit (`-p`) for serving students can go as low as `-20`. Adding `20` ensures all costs remain non-negative (`[0, 40]` for all edges).

3. **Adjusting the Final Cost:**
   - Since normalization artificially inflates the cost on **source-to-day** edges, the total flow cost includes this extra `+20` per unit of flow.
   - Subtract `20 * flow` from the total cost to retrieve the original result.

#### Steps for the Optimized Approach

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Add edges from the **super-source** to the days:
     - Capacity: Meals produced.
     - Cost: `c + 20` (normalized production cost).
   - Add edges from the days to the **super-sink**:
     - Capacity: Student demand.
     - Cost: `20 - p` (normalized profit).
   - Add edges between consecutive days to model storage:
     - Capacity: Meals that can be stored.
     - Cost: `e` (unchanged, already non-negative).

2. **Solve Min-Cost Max-Flow:**
   - Use `successive_shortest_path_nonnegative_weights`, which requires all edge costs to be non-negative.

3. **Adjust Cost:**
   - After computing the total cost, subtract `20 * flow` to undo the effect of normalization on the **source-to-day edges**.

#### Why Subtract `20 * flow`?

- Each unit of flow from the source is normalized with an additional `+20` on the cost.
- To ensure correctness, this extra cost must be removed from the total cost.
