#### 1. For each 0 to i:
- we're saying: **"I’m definitely taking figure 0, and I’m not taking figure i"**.
- The flow algorithm then acts as a **black box**:
  - It tells us the optimal way to **partition the remaining figures** into two groups:
    - **our group**: figure 0 + cheapest things to take with 0
    - **our friend’s group** figure i + what else remains.

The flow result ensures:
- The **total cost of the limbs we cut** (to separate 0 from i) is minimized.
- we get the "cheapest combination" of figures to take home, under the condition that we must include 0 and exclude i.

---

#### 2. Repeat for every i:
- For every i, we repeat this process:
  - Assume 0 is **ours**, and i is **our friend’s**.
  - Compute the **min-cut** (using flow), which determines the optimal partition of the other figures.
- Record the cost for each 0 to i configuration.

---

#### 3. Symmetry: Reverse the Role of i:
- By basic combinatorics, our approach so far **only covers half the scenarios**, because it always assumes 0 is included in our group.
- To cover the other half:
  - Swap the roles: **Assume i is ours, and 0 is our friend’s.**
  - Compute the min-cut for i to 0, and repeat the same process.

---

#### 4. Global Minimum:
- After computing all possible scenarios (both 0 to i and i to 0):
  - Take the minimum cost from all configurations.
- This ensures that we’ve considered every possible way to split the sculpture into two valid groups.

---

### Why This Works

The **flow algorithm** guarantees that for each configuration, we’re getting the optimal partition of figures (minimizing cutting cost) under the fixed condition:
- Either 0 is in our group and i is not, or
- i is in our group and 0 is not.

By combining the results from both directions, we’ve exhaustively explored all possible partitions.

### Visualizing the Idea

1. **Forward Scenario 0 to i**:
   - **Input**: "I'm taking \( 0 \), and I’m giving away \( i \)."
   - **Output**: The best possible set of figures to take home, minimizing the cutting cost.

2. **Reverse Scenario i to 0**:
   - **Input**: "I’m taking \( i \), and I’m giving away \( 0 \)."
   - **Output**: The best possible set of figures to take home, minimizing the cutting cost.

---

- **Flow acts as a black box** to find the optimal split under a fixed condition (e.g., "taking 0 and not taking i").
- Computing both 0 to i and i to 0 ensures that **all possible ways of splitting the sculpture** are considered.
- The result is the globally optimal solution.
