## Solution Approach

1. **Key Idea**:
   - A free-standing union exists if there is "trapped surplus" â€” positive balance that cannot be fully used to pay external debts.
   - The max-flow algorithm determines whether surplus can be redistributed optimally to satisfy deficits and external debts.

2. **Graph Representation**:
   - **Source to Provinces**: Positive balances (b[i] > 0) are modeled as edges from the source to provinces with capacity equal to their balance.
   - **Provinces to Sink**: Negative balances (b[i] < 0) are modeled as edges from provinces to the sink with capacity equal to the absolute value of their balance.
   - **Debts**: Directed edges between provinces (i to j) represent debts with capacities equal to the debt amounts.

3. **Union Insight**:
   - A positively balanced province is included in the union only if its surplus helps cancel more external debt than it contributes to the total flow.
   - A negatively balanced province is included if the debt cancellation it enables offsets its deficit.

4. **Flow and Cut**:
   - The max-flow algorithm minimizes the total flow between the source and the sink by finding a "cut" that separates the graph.
   - If a positively balanced province is not in the union, its surplus must flow out of the source, contributing to the total flow.
   - If a negatively balanced province is in the union, its deficit must flow out of the cut, contributing to the total flow.

5. **Decision Logic**:
   - Compute the total positive balance as the sum of all positive balances.
   - Compute the maximum flow from the source to the sink.
   - If the maximum flow is less than the total positive balance, some surplus is trapped, meaning a free-standing union exists. Output "yes."
   - Otherwise, output "no."

6. **Why It Works**:
   - The source edges ensure that all surplus is either used within the union or contributes to the flow.
   - The flow captures all external debt payments, ensuring the optimal union is found.
   - Internal debts are automatically canceled by the flow algorithm and do not affect the decision.
